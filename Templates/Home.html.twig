			<h2 class="fs-1 fw-normal text-center">What is MVC</h2>

			<p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base">MVC is an acronym for Model-View-Controller. Is a software design pattern, or software architecture pattern formulated in the 1970's, focused on code reuse and in the separation of concepts in three interconnected layers, where data presentation and user interaction (front-end) are separated of the methods that interact with the database (back-end).</p>

			<p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base">Commonly used for the software development of user interfaces that divides the application into parts. This is done to separate internal information representations from the ways in which the information is presented to and accepted by the user, leading to parallel development in an efficient way.</p>

			<p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base">Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server.</p>

			<p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base">A pratical case is a web application in which the vision is an HTML document (or derived) generated by the application. The Controller receives a GET input or POST after a stimulus from the user and decides how to process it, invoking objects from the domain to handle the business logic, and finally invoking a vision to present the way out.</p>
