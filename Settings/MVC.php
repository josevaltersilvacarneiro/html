 * MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a widely adopted architectural
 * pattern used in software development to organize and structure
 * the components of a project. It provides a clear separation of
 * concerns between the data (Model), the user interface (View),
 * and the application logic (Controller). This separation
 * promotes modularity, code reusability, and maintainability.
